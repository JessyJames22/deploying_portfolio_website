## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following:

- Ansible installed on your local machine.
- SSH access to the target server.

## Components

### Ansible Role Structure

The Ansible role is organized into the following directories:

- **tasks:** Contains the main playbook tasks.
- **handlers:** Includes handlers for events triggered in tasks.
- **defaults:** Stores default variable values.
- **vars:** Contains variable definitions.
- **files:** Holds files needed for deployment.
- **meta:** Defines role dependencies.

## Why Ansible?

Ansible is an open-source automation tool that simplifies complex infrastructure tasks. Here's why it's a great choice for deploying your portfolio website:

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Ansible allows you to define your infrastructure as code, making it easy to version, share, and replicate.

- **Agentless:** Ansible doesn't require any agents on managed nodes, simplifying setup and management.

- **Declarative Syntax:** Uses YAML, providing a human-readable and easy-to-understand syntax.

- **Community and Extensibility:** A large community and extensive module library make it easy to find solutions and extend functionality.
